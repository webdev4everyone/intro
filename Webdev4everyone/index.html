	<h2> Getting Started with HTML5 </h2> <!--This is about what HTML5 is?-->
	<p> HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
	It is the fifth and latest major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
	recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained
	by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), 
	the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). </p>

	<h2> How to start an HTML document? </h2>
	<!--How to start it-->
	<p> This is how you start an HTML code. Note: This code will not add any functions to the HTML page yet.
	It will just make the browser recognise this is an HTML page. </p>
